# Tictactoe AI Player

This project aims to create a tictactoe AI player that plays perfectly. It will do so by training against a perfectly optimized tictactoe bot.

This project is a practice project for my other, bigger scale project: to create a tetris AI player. I decided to create this project first to gain some experience before beginning that project.

This project involves 4 programming elements:
- The actual tictactoe game
- Using image thresholding to input the grid to the AI player, converting the initial image input to a numpy array, which is easier to operate on.
- Creating an AI player that trains.
- Using pyGUI to input the moves of the AI player to the actual game.
